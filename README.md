# city-skyline
This project is created as part of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course.
In this mini-project, I learned how to:
-Declare and use CSS variables for colors, sizes, and reusable values
-Apply variables to multiple elements for consistency and easier maintenance
-Create a responsive skyline design using HTML and CSS
